# Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree

## Statement

Given an array of integers, nums, sorted in ascending order, your task is to construct a height-balanced binary search tree (BST) from this array.

In a height-balanced BST, the difference of heights of the left subtree and right subtree of any node is not more than 1.

**Note**: There can be multiple valid BSTs for a given input.
