# Build Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

## Statement

Create a binary tree from two integer arrays, p_order and i_order, where p_order represents a preorder traversal of a binary tree, and i_order represents an inorder traversal of the same tree.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ p_order.length, i_order.length ≤ 1000
- i_order.length == p_order.length
- −1000 ≤ p_order[i], i_order[i] ≤ 1000
- p_order and i_order consist of unique values.
- Each value of i_order also appears in p_order and vice versa.
