# Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree

## Statement

Given the root node of a binary tree with n nodes, your task is to find the lowest common ancestor of two of its nodes, p and q.

**Note**: The lowest common ancestor of two nodes, p and q, is defined as the lowest node in the binary tree that has both p and q as descendants.

A node can also be a descendant of itself. For example, if q is a descendant of p, and we know that p is a descendant of itself, then p will be the lowest common ancestor of p and q.
