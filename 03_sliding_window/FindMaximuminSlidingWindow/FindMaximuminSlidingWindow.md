# Find Maximum in Sliding Window

## Statement

Given an integer list, nums, find the maximum values in all the contiguous subarrays (windows) of size w.

Note: If the window size is greater than the array size, we consider the entire array as a single window.

## Constraint

$1$ ≤ arr.length ≤ $10 ^ {3}$

$-10^{4}$ ≤ arr[i] ≤ $10^{4}$

$1$ ≤ w
