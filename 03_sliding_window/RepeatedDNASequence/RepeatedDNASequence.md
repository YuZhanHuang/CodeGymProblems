# Repeated DNA Sequence

## Statement

Given a string, s, that represents a DNA subsequence, and a number k, return all the contiguous subsequences (substrings) of length k that occur more than once in the string. The order of the returned subsequences does not matter. If no repeated substring is found, the function should return an empty set.
