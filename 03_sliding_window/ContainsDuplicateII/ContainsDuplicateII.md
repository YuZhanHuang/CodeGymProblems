# Contains Duplicate II

## Statement

You are given an integer array, nums, and an integer k. Determine whether two distinct indices, i and j, are in the array, such that nums[i] == nums[j] and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k. Return TRUE if such indices exist; otherwise, return FALSE.

## Constraints:

1 ≤ nums.length ≤ $10^{3}$

$-10^{3}$ ≤ nums[i] ≤ $10^{3}$

0 ≤ k ≤ $10^{4}$
