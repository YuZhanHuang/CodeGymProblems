# Merge K Sorted Lists

## Statement

Given an array of k sorted linked lists, your task is to merge them into a single sorted linked list and return the head of this linked list.

## Constraints

- k = lists.length
- 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^3
- 0 ≤ lists[i].length ≤ 500
- -10^3 ≤ lists[i][j] ≤ 10^3
- Each lists[i] is sorted in ascending order.
- The sum of all lists[i].length will not exceed 10^3.
