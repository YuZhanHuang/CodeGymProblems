# Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column

## Statement

Given an array of n stones in a two-dimensional plane, where each stone is represented by a pair of x and y coordinates, find the maximum number of stones we can remove with the following condition:

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column with another stone that has not been removed so far.

Stones are provided as an array, stones, of length n, where stones[i] = [x[i], y[i]] represents the ith stone. Return the maximum possible number of stones that can be removed.
