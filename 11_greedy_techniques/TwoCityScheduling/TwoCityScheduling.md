# Two City Scheduling

## Statement

A recruiter plans to hire n people and conducts their interviews at two different locations of the company. He evaluates the cost of inviting candidates to both these locations. The plan is to invite 50% at one location, and the rest at the other location, keeping costs to a minimum.

We are given an array, costs, where costs[i] = [aCosti, bCosti], the cost of inviting the ith person to City A is aCosti, and the cost of inviting the same person to City B is bCosti.

You need to determine the minimum cost to invite all the candidates for the interview such that exactly n/2 people are invited in each city.

## Constraints

- 2 ≤ costs.length ≤ 100
- costs.length is even
- 1 ≤ aCosti, bCosti ≤ 1000
