# Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree

## Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, display the values of its nodes while performing a level order traversal. Return the node values for all levels in a string separated by the character `:`. If the tree is empty, i.e., the number of nodes is 0, then return "None" as the output.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 500].
- −10^3 ≤ Node.data ≤ 10^3
