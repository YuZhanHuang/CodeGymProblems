# Course Schedule

## Statement

There are a total of num_courses courses you have to take. The courses are labeled from 0 to num_courses - 1. You are also given a prerequisites array, where prerequisites[i] = [a[i], b[i]] indicates that you must take course b[i] first if you want to take the course a[i]. For example, the pair [1,0] indicates that to take course 1, you have to first take course 0.

Return TRUE if all of the courses can be finished. Otherwise, return FALSE.
