# Cyclic Sort

## Statement

You are given an integer array, nums of size n, where each number is distinct and falls within the range [1,n]. Your task is to sort the array in place while ensuring a time complexity of O(n) and using only O(1) extra space.

## Constraints

- n == nums.length
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3
- Each element in nums is unique and within the range [1,n].
