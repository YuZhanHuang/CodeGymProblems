# Find the Corrupt Pair

## Statement

We are given an unsorted array, nums, with n elements and each element is in the range [1,n] inclusive. The array originally contained all the elements from 1 to n but due to a data error, one of the numbers is duplicated, which causes another number missing. Find and return the corrupt pair (missing, duplicated).
