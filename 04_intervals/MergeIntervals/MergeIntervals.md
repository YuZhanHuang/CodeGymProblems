# Merge Intervals

## Statement

We are given an array of closed intervals, intervals, where each interval has a start time and an end time. The input array is sorted with respect to the start times of each interval. For example, intervals = [[1,4], [3,6], [7,9]] is sorted in terms of start times 1, 3, and 7.

Your task is to merge the overlapping intervals and return a new output array consisting of only the non-overlapping intervals.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ intervals.length ≤ 10^4
- intervals[i].length = 2
- 0 ≤ start time ≤ end time ≤ 10^4
