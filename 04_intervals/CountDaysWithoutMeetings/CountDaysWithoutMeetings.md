# Count Days Without Meetings

## Statement

You are given a positive integer, days, which represents the total number of days an employee is available for work, starting from day 1. You are also given a 2D array, meetings, where each entry meetings[i] = [start_i, end_i] indicates that a meeting is scheduled from day start_i to day end_i (both inclusive).

Your task is to count the days when the employee is available for work but has no scheduled meetings.

**Note:** The meetings may overlap.
