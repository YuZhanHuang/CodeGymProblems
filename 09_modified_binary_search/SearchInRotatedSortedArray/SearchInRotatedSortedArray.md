# Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Statement

Given a sorted integer array, nums, and an integer value, target, the array is rotated by some arbitrary number. Search and return the index of target in this array. If the target does not exist, return -1.

## Constraints

- All values in nums are unique.
- The values in nums are sorted in ascending order.
- The array may have been rotated by some arbitrary number.
- 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 5000
- -10^4 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^4
- -10^4 ≤ target ≤ 10^4
