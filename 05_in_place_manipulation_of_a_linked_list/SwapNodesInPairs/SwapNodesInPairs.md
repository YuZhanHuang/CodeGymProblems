# Swap Nodes in Pairs

## Statement

Given a singly linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes of the linked list. After the swap, return the head of the linked list.

**Note:** Solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes. In other words, only the nodes themselves can be changed.

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0,100].
- 0 ≤ Node.value ≤ 100
