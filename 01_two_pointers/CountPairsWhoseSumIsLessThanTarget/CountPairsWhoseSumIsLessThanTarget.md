# Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target

## Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array, nums, of length n, and an integer target. Your task is to determine the number of distinct pairs of indexes (i, j) such that:

- 0 ≤ i < j < n (i.e., i comes before j in the array)
- The sum of the elements of the indexes (i, j), (i.e., nums[i] + nums[j]), is strictly less than the target.
