# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III

## Statement

You are given two nodes, p and q. The task is to return their lowest common ancestor (LCA). Both nodes have a reference to their parent node. The tree's root is not provided; you must use the parent pointers to find the nodes' common ancestor.

**Note:** The lowest common ancestor of two nodes, p and q, is the lowest node in the binary tree, with both p and q as descendants.

In a tree, a descendant of a node is any node reachable by following edges downward from that node, including the node itself.

## Constraints

- -10^4 ≤ Node.data ≤ 10^4
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2,500].
- All Node.data are unique.
- p != q
- Both p and q are present in the tree.
